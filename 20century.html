          1905 Russian Revolution (First Russian Revolution)
          <ul>
            <li>Date: January 22nd, 1905 â€“ late 1905/early 1906</li>
            <li>
              Location: Russia
            </li>
            <li>
              Groups Uprising: Russian Revolutionaries (Including peasants,
              industrial workers, the Party of Socialist Revolutionaries, the
              Russian Social Deomocratic Labour Party, and more)
            </li>
            <li>
              Number of People: Unknown (We can guess in the (high) tens or
              (low) hundreds of thousands)
            </li>
            <li>
              Leaders: Viktor Chernov, Leon Trotsky
            </li>
            <li>
              Reason(s): The people became more aware of the need for reform
              (peasants din't earn enough and couldn't sell/mortgage their land,
              ethnic/national minorities were systematically Russified and
              discriminated against, industrial workers were banned from
              striking and organizing labour unions, etc), Russia's (to them)
              embarrasing defeat in the Russo-Japanese war, Bloody Sunday
            </li>
            <li>
              Result: Suppression of revolution (including (allegedly) deaths in
              the thousands and the exiling of tens of thousands), reforms
              including the creation of a Duma, the inactment of the October
              Manifesto, and the Russian Constitution of 1906
            </li>

        <div>
          February Revolution
          <ul>
            <li>
              Date: (N.S.) March 8th-16th, 1917 (The revolution occured during
              Febuary according to the calender Russia was using at the time
              (Old Style, the Julian calender (O.S.) as opposed to New Style,
              the Gregorian calender (N.S.))
            </li>
            <li>
              Location: Petrograd (Formerly (and currently) Saint Petersburg),
              Russia
            </li>
            <li>
              Groups Uprising: Russian Revolutionaries (Including the
              Constitutional Democratic Party, the Octobrist Party, the
              Progressive Party, the Socialist Revolutionary Party, and the
              Russian Social Democratic Labour Party), defected Petrograd
              garrison regiments (soldiers), common people/Petrograd citizens
              (particularly women)
            </li>
            <li>Number of People: (at its height) +200,000</li>
            <li>
              Leaders: Georgy Lvov, Pavel Miliukov, Alexander Guchkov, Mikhail
              Rodzianko, Alexander Kerensky, Viktor Chernov, Julius Martov,
              Nikolay Chkheidze, Alexander Shliapnikov
            </li>
            <li>
              Reason(s): Failure to modernise economic, social, and policical
              structures while maintaining autocracy, continuous cruel treatment
              of the peasants, poor working conditions for industrial workers,
              new polictical/social awareness and rising knowledge of western
              political ideas, food shortages and threats of faminine, a rise in
              layoffs and inflation (which wages didn't rise to meet), natural
              "disasters" (such as continous freezing temperatures and dramatic
              shifts in climate), Russian military failures/ineptitude during
              World War I (including poor military leadership by the tsar and
              many of those under him, inadequate supplies, mass desertions,
              etc), (resulting from Tsar Nicholas II taking personal command)
              the governing of the unpopular and ineffective Tsarina Alexandra
              (who was also German. They were fighting the Germans) and Grigori
              Rasputin (who was even more disliked)
            </li>
            <li>
              Result: The revolutionaries won, the monarchy was ended with the
              abdication of Tsar Nicholas II (and the refusal of his brother,
              Grand Duke Michael, to take the throne. In 1918 the former tsar,
              tsarina, and their children, among others, would be murdered), the
              formation/proclamation of the Russian Republic, the sharing of
              dual power between the Provisional Government and the Petrograd
              Soviet, and, later on, the October Revolution (also known as the
              Bolshevik Coup), which would result in the formation of the
              Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic (Soviet Russia,
              unofficially)
