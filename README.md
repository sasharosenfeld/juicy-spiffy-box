# Welcome to My Project!

Hi, I'm Sasha, and I decided to compose a list of uprsings (including many different kinds) against Tsarist Russia, which ruled from the late 16th century to the early 20th century! I started with the 17th century, after the Time of Troubles and the beginning of the Romanov dynasty that would rule under Tsar Nicholas II, the last tsar of Russia.
